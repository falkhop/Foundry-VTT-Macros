# Foundry-VTT-Macros
A set of macros made for use within the Foundry Virtual Table Top.

These macros were made to assist in constructing complex roll formulas quickly to speed up combat game play.
Additional, these macros were made for Foundry Version 9, and require some or all of the following modules:
 - Combat Utility Belt https://foundryvtt.com/packages/combat-utility-belt/
 - Dice So Nice! https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dice-so-nice

This content is not formatted to be directly downloaded and imported into Foundry, but rather can be copy/pasted into the "Command" section of "Script" type macros.
